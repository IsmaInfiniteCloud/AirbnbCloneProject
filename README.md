#Project Overview
Our project is a functional clone of Airbnb's core features. We have built this application from scratch, replicating the user interface and re-engineering the back-end using the MERN stack. This is a full-stack web application, demonstrating our skills in front-end and back-end development, database management, and UI/UX design.

#Core Features
The application provides the following key features:

User registration and authentication
Property listing, viewing, and booking
Search functionality with filters
User profiles and reviews
Secure payment processing
